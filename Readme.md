# Readme

This is the web app that displays the collection of thesis and dissertations for the Computer Science department at Virginia Tech.  The collection exists on the web in two different websites. Our goal here is to bring all the information into one central place and to provide added benefits to current and potential students.

## Requires
This code uses the template system in my github account.

Most of the files have:

	require_once("template.php")

And most of the files make use of the `*.tmpl` files.
